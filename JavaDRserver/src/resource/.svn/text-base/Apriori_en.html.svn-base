      <td align="justify">Apriori is an algorithm for association
that works as follows:&nbsp; In the first sweeping, the algorithm
counts how many occurrences an item has&nbsp;&nbsp; in the original
data set, determinating type 1 frequent item sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
subsequent steps of the algorithm are two, first, frequent item
sets&nbsp;found in the first sweeping&nbsp;are&nbsp;used to generate
candidate item sets. And second, candidate item sets support is
counted&nbsp;by means of new sweeping&nbsp; to the data base.&nbsp;
This process keeps going until frequent item sets are not found
anymore.&nbsp;Connection with other drag and drop components is
similar&nbsp;&nbsp; in every single algorithm, and it gets done as
shown below. &nbsp;<br>

When releasing the icon in the work area A. is possible to connect the
icons&nbsp;&nbsp; by means of a thread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
doing right click on the icon appears an emergent menu,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which consists of the following options :&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li>Delete option, deletes the algorithm icon from the work area.</li>


          <li>Configure option, adapts the parameters of the algorithm to the necessities&nbsp;of the analyst.</li>


          <li>Run option executes the algorithm.</li>

The association algorithms configuration is similar in all of them and&nbsp;gets done as follows:<br>

When acceding to the configuration option, on the work area&nbsp;&nbsp;
appears a window B, so the user can configure the support&nbsp;&nbsp;
for the algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The execution of
all the algorithms for association is similar.&nbsp;&nbsp; We accede to
the Run option from the contextual menu.<br>

When executing the algorithm, its icon is changed by an
animation,&nbsp;&nbsp; as it is in B, which indicates that the process
is&nbsp;in execution. The run time, is proportional to the size of the
data base&nbsp;and to the number and type of processes that this
algorithm involves.<br>
