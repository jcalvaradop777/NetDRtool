      <td align="justify">FPGrowth is an algorithm for association,
uses an innovator and compact&nbsp;&nbsp; structure of data called
Frequent Patterns Tree,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is a structure that stores
crucial and quantitative information&nbsp;&nbsp; about the frequent
patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When building the FP-tree
(conditional) and within which&nbsp;&nbsp; is carried out
recursivamente the mining.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A frequent item set
in any transaction always is&nbsp;&nbsp; in a path of Frequent Patterns
trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the technique used is searching,
employee in the Mining&nbsp;&nbsp; and it is based in splitting, with
the method "divide and conquer".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these
techniques reduces searching costs
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connection with other drag and
drop components is similar&nbsp;&nbsp; in every single algorithm, and
it gets done as shown below.<br>

When releasing the icon in the work area A. is possible to connect the
icons&nbsp;&nbsp; by means of a thread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When doing right click on the icon
appears an emergent menu,&nbsp;&nbsp; which consists of the following options :&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li>Delete option, deletes the algorithm icon from the work area.</li>
        <li>Configure option, adapts the parameters of the algorithm to the necessities&nbsp;of the analyst.</li>
        <li>Run option executes the algorithm.</li>
      </ul>
The association algorithms configuration is similar in all of them and&nbsp;gets done as follows:<br>

When acceding to the configuration option, on the work area&nbsp;&nbsp; appears a
window B, so the user can configure the support&nbsp;&nbsp; for the
algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The execution of all the algorithms for association is
similar.&nbsp;&nbsp; We accede to the Run option from the contextual menu.<br>

When executing the algorithm, its icon is changed by an animation,&nbsp;&nbsp; as
it is in B, which indicates that the process is&nbsp;in execution. The run
time, is proportional to the size of the data base&nbsp;and to the number
and type of processes that this algorithm involves.<br>
