      <td align="justify">Mate is an algorithm for classification. The Classification of data is a two steps process : <br>
      <br>
First, a model is built based in a data set denominated training
set.&nbsp; In the training set, each tupla is assumed that&nbsp;
belongs to a predefined class, determined by a&nbsp;class
attribute.&nbsp;So, classification is supervized learning&nbsp; the
rest of attributes are denominate attributes condition.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Second, the model is test with another&nbsp; data set denominated test
set.&nbsp;Mate. The operator Mate generates, for every tupla from&nbsp;
a relation, all the possible combinations formed by&nbsp; the non null
values of the beloging attributes&nbsp; of a list&nbsp; of denominated
attributes Condition, and the non null value&nbsp; of the class
attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mate take as input each tupla of R and produces
a new&nbsp; relation whose scheme is formed by the attributes
condition,&nbsp; a list of attributes condition and the class
attribute, the class attribute with&nbsp; tuplas formed by all the
possible combinations of each&nbsp; one of the attributes condition
with the class attribute, remaining&nbsp; values of the attributes
become null.&nbsp;Mate matches in each partition all the attributes
condition&nbsp; with the class attribute, which facilitates the count
and the later calculation of&nbsp; the measures of entropy and the gain
of information.&nbsp; Mate operator generates these combinations, in a
single sweeping&nbsp; over the training table (which affects the
efficiency in the decision tree&nbsp; buliding process ).&nbsp;
Accuracy of the model is calculate according to the percentage of&nbsp;
test examples that are correctly classified.&nbsp;Connection with other
drag and drop components is similar&nbsp; in every single algorithm,
and it gets done as shown below. <br>

When releasing the icon in the work area A. is possible to connect the
icons&nbsp;&nbsp; by means of a thread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When doing right click on the icon
appears an emergent menu,&nbsp;&nbsp; which consists of the following options :&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li>Delete option, deletes the algorithm icon from the work area.</li>
        <li>Configure option, adapts the parameters of the algorithm to the necessities&nbsp;of the analyst.</li>
        <li>Run option executes the algorithm.</li>

The classification&nbsp; algorithms configuration is made&nbsp;as follows:<br>

When acceding to the configuration option, on the work area&nbsp; appears a
contextual menu, which is divided in two parts : one for parameters of
Pruning and another one for stablish a training set.&nbsp;&nbsp; In pruning, the
analyst has the possibility of configuring a minimum&nbsp; of registries per
node and also should provide a threshold that&nbsp; is going to make stop
the pruning of a certain node.&nbsp;&nbsp; The analyst also should configure the
size of the training set.&nbsp;&nbsp; All parameters are in percentage terms.&nbsp; of
the algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The execution of all the algorithms for
classification is similar,&nbsp; acceding to the Run option by the
contextual menu.<br>

When executing the algorithm, its icon is changed by an animation,&nbsp;&nbsp; as
it is in B, which indicates that the process is&nbsp;in execution. The run
time, is proportional to the size of the data base&nbsp;and to the number
and type of processes that this algorithm involves.<br>
