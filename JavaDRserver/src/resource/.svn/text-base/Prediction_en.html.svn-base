attribute value belongs to.&nbsp; Its fundation is the obtained
decision tree&nbsp;gotten after an algorithm for clasification been
aplayed&nbsp; to the data collected from the connection with a data
base or a text file.&nbsp;Connection with other drag and drop
components is made&nbsp;&nbsp; with two specific modules which are :
algorithms for classification and connection icons that can be a data

      Prediction icon D appears in the
work area.&nbsp; Usaje of this component is conditionated to
following&nbsp; requirements.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
A training data set must have been loaded A,&nbsp;&nbsp; an algorithm
for clasification B must be applied to A&nbsp; and a testing data set C
must had have been loaded to&nbsp; apply the obtained model after B get
done. <br>
      <br>
Information coming from A and B feeds&nbsp; the icon D this way, is
possible to do prediction on the testing data set C.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
